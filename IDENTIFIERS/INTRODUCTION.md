**C identifiers**

  1.C identifiers represent the name in the C program, for example, variables, functions, arrays, structures, unions, labels, etc. 
  2.An identifier can be composed of letters such as uppercase, lowercase letters, underscore, digits, but the starting letter should be either an alphabet or an underscore.
 
 
**Rules for constructing C identifiers**

  1.The first character of an identifier should be either an alphabet or an underscore, and then it can be followed by any of the character, digit, or underscore.
  2.It should not begin with any numerical digit.
  3.In identifiers, both uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct. Therefore, we can say that identifiers are case sensitive.
  4.Commas or blank spaces cannot be specified within an identifier.
  5.Keywords cannot be represented as an identifier.
  6.The length of the identifiers should not be more than 31 characters.
  7.Identifiers should be written in such a way that it is meaningful, short, and easy to read.
  
**Types of identifiers**

  1.Internal identifier
  2.External identifier
  
  
**Internal Identifier**

If the identifier is not used in the external linkage, then it is known as an internal identifier. The internal identifiers can be local variables.

**External Identifier**

If the identifier is used in the external linkage, then it is known as an external identifier. The external identifiers can be function names, global variables.
