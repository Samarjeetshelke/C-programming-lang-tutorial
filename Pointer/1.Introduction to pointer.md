**Pointer in C Programming**
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. 
Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address.
The mportent things is it contain 2Byte memory space (Acorrding to 16 bit compiler).

 int x=6;
     x          ->Name of adrress
 |   6   |      ->Innitial  value 
    208         ->Address
    
**Basic Syntax**:-
 Data-Type * name.

 **code**:-
 
 void main(){
     int x=10;                                 x             y                 ->Name
     int * y;                               |  10  |      |  800  |            ->nitaial value
     y=&x;                                    800            1200              ->Address
     clrscr();
     printf("\n%d",x);         10
     printf("\n%u",&x);        800   
     printf("\n%d",* (&x));    10
     printf("\n%u",y);         800
     printf("\n%u",&y);        1200
     printf("\n%u",* (&y));    800
     printf("\n%d",* y);       10                    imp
     printf("\n%d",* ( * (&y)));    1o
     
 getch();
 }
