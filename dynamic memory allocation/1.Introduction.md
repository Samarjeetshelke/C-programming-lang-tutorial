**Dynamic memory allocation**:-
Since C is a structured language, it has some fixed rules for programming. One of it includes changing the size of an array.
An array is collection of items stored at continuous memory locations. The process of allocating memory at runtime is knonw as Dynamic memory allocation. 
C language does not have specificationn for this but  C provides some functions to achieve these tasks. There are 4 library functions provided by C defined under 
<stdlib.h> header file to facilitate dynamic memory allocation 
in C programming. They are:

1.malloc()
2.calloc()
3.free()
4.realloc()

**C malloc() method**:-
“malloc” or “memory allocation” method in C is used to dynamically allocate a single large block of memory with the specified size.
It returns a pointer of type void which can be cast into a pointer of any form. It initializes each block with default garbage value.

Syntax:

ptr = (cast-type*) malloc(byte-size)

---

**C calloc() method**:-
“calloc” or “contiguous allocation” method in C is used to dynamically allocate the specified number of blocks of memory of the specified type.
It initializes each block with a default value ‘0’.

Syntax:

ptr = (cast-type*)calloc(n, element-size);

---

**C free() method**:-
“free” method in C is used to dynamically de-allocate the memory. The memory allocated using functions malloc() and calloc() is not de-allocated on their own.
Hence the free() method is used, whenever the dynamic memory allocation takes place. It helps to reduce wastage of memory by freeing it.

Syntax:

free(ptr);
